# gesture_recognition
Gesture Recognition based on Image Processing. Application - controlling mouse cursor and clicks using gesture.
This was my college project back in 2010

The application is written using Matlab
The application works on the following logic - 
1. Initialize an identifier color at starting as well as the base environment
2. Extract the position of the pixels in the incoming live video per frame
3. Determine based on position, what would be the gesture of the user
4. If the gesture stands recognized using the declared parameters, perform relevant action
